# ansible-role-module-cfn-lookup
Role / Module for looking up CloudFormation outputs

This can be used as either a role or a module. 

If used as a role, run the role with the <strong>cfn_lookup_stack_name</strong> parameter:
```
roles:
  - role: cfn_lookup
    cfn_lookup_stacks: 
      - stack_name: "some_stack"
        fact_name: "some_fact" 
```
This will look up the stack outputs for stack "some_stack" and place them in the fact "some_fact".

If used as a module, just run the role first with no parameters, then run the module as a task:
```
- name: Look up stack outputs by stack name
  cfn_lookup: 
    stack_name: "some_stack"
    fact_name: "some_fact"
  register: stack_outputs 
```
